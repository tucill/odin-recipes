    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Chicken: Clean the chicken pieces and pat them dry with
        paper towels. Season with salt and pepper, then let them marinate for
        about 15-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the Coating: In a bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, cornstarch,
        garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Egg Wash: In another bowl, beat the eggs until well combined
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat the chicken: Dip each chicken piece into the egg wash, allowing
        excess to drip off, then dredge it in the flour mixture until fully
        coated. Press lightly to ensure the coating sticks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the Oil: In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat enough cooking oil
        over medium heat until it reaches about 350 degrees Celsius
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the Chicken: Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot
        oil. Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding. Cook for about 10-15
        minutes, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and cooked
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and Serve: Once cooked, remove the chicken and place it on a plate
        lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve hot with your
        favorite dipping sauce or sides.
